I would like to thank my advisor, professor Elke Rundensteiner for the guidance and mentorship I received from her during the last two years. Her patience and attention to details has been instrumental in making me a better researcher. I also want to thank my thesis reader, professor Jacob Whitehill, for giving useful feedback to make this thesis a success. I would also like to thank Ramoza Ahsan for her continued support and useful feedback she provided during this time. With their help, I have been able to improve my knowledge in data science in general and machine learning in particular. I would also like to thank DSRG in general, particularly Luke Buquicchio and Walter Gerych.  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the generous support by the U.S. State Department for funding my master's degree under the Fulbright Scholarship program.
