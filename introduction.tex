\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and motivation}
Automated trespassing detection is an important problem that has application ranging from railroad security to safe neighborhood. In US, 1080 people were either killed or injured as a direct result of trespassing in 2016\cite{2017trespass}. The number increased to 1224 casualties (13.3 \% increase) in 2017\cite{2018trespass}. Recently, Worcester Police Department (WPD) conducted a four month long study of trespassing activity and found at least 150 trespassing events involving more than 200 trespassers  with the average trespassing event lasting over 15 minutes. Trespassers frequently encountered either a moving or stationary train and in most cases, received little warning about the approaching train. This situation clearly poses a risk for both the train as well as the trespasser.
In most cases, contact with the train proves to
be fatal. Aside from human costs, these casualties, whether fatal or not, are quite expensive. Property damage, emergency services, safety investigations, insurance, legal and delay costs may account for hundreds of thousands up to millions of dollars per accident.

A straight forward solution to this problem is to station police officers at the potential trespassing sites round the clock. However, this option has little practicability due to sheer requirement of large no. of trained human resource. Another solution is to setup a surveillance network of CCTV cameras and employ human analysts to review video feed. Video surveillance data can be converted to trespassing statistics. This can be useful to determine potential trespassing sites and time for more efficient resource utilization i.e. Police officers or relevant personnel can be sent to potential sites only. Though attractive,this manual approach has certain downsides:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Limitation of human resource:} 
In this era of big data, we simply don't have enough human resources. Scaling up the surveillance network doesn't mean adding more cameras, but also addition of more trained human analysts. 

\item \textbf{Subjectivity in analysis:} Even well trained humans tend to be subjective in nature. What may be considered a threat by one analyst may not be considered so by the other. 

\item \textbf{Unreliability:} Manual surveillance is a dull and tedious task. Over a period of time, a human analyst may lose interest and neglect penitential activities.
\end{itemize}


Due to above mentioned reasons, bringing automation to any trespassing prevention solution is of vital importance. Trespassing detection serves as the first step towards any solution. A reliable automated trespassing detection solution  not only provides detections in a timely fashion but also allows us to develop advanced analytics by studying trespassing patterns over time. For example, analysis over a period of six months may reveal that a group of children like to play football during evening time. Certain locations might see increased trespassing during the morning and evening time because people returning home from jobs may want to take a short-cut. Other locations such as underpass and bridges may provide an ideal meeting location for drug addicts.  An advanced trespassing prevention and analytics tool may use more information than just trespassing detection and study correlation patterns between demographics, weather and traffic etc.  This can help in making better prediction and prevention of trespassing.

As indicated above, an automated trespassing detection system serves as the backbone for prevention system. Therefore in this thesis, we shall focus on that. We aim to develop a computer vision based detection system that takes in a colored surveillance video as  input and produces  trespassing detections as output. Following are some of the key advantages of our proposed system:


\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Speed:} Since, the system is fully automated we can take advantage of high performance computing to speed up video processing. Multiple surveillance videos can also be processed in parallel by using multiple compute nodes. 

\item \textbf{Scalibility:} More and more data can be efficiently handled by simply adding more computational resources. In most cases, this can have a side advance of lower running costs of the complete surveillance system.
 
\item \textbf{Relative objectivity:} All the data is analysed by the same system i.e. data gets processed using the same \textit{set of equations}. This adds an inherent notion of objectivity to the results w-r-t underlying \textit{set of equations}.

\item \textbf{Reproducibility:} Computers are well known for carrying out tedious tasks with reproducible results  (a quality that humans lack). It shall always give the same output to a given input provided the internal functionality doesn't change. This property is useful in studying errors and working towards improving them.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Problem definition}
\label{sec:problem-definition}
Given an input surveillance video, the problem of trespassing detection is to classify whether each frame has  human trespassing activity or not. In order to keep it simple, we define trespasser as a human being near a railway line. Notice that anyone within camera field of view shall be considered a trespasser. Detecting a trespasser in a given frame is a special form of general object detection problem where only objects of type \textit{person} are detected.

\subsection{Goal}
\label{sec:goal}
Although in section \ref{sec:problem-definition} we formulate our problem as classifying each frame as trespassing or not, we have a more ambitious goal. We not only want to predict the label but also want to do so in a time efficient manner. We notice that railroad surveillance video is sparse in terms of trespassing activity. We aim to leverage this property to reduce the processing time.  

Furthermore, we notice that detection performance and speed are two opposite goals. Generally, if one wishes to improve the speed, they will have to sacrifice accuracy\footnote{refers to how good a detector is performing, not necessarily the metric accuracy} and vice versa. Therefore, we are interested in developing a flexible solution that is capable of trading-off performance and computational time. 



\subsection{Challenges}
\label{sec:challenges}
There are several key challenges in building a computer vision based trespassing detection system. Figure \ref{fig:challenges} shows a few of them. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Occlusion:} Several time trespassers are occluded by other objects or fellow trespassers. If the occluding object is stationary, trespasser may become un-occluded later. However, it becomes a real challenge if two trespassers move side by side.  
    
    \item \textbf{Low resolution:} Most of the surveillance cameras capture low resolution videos to cut down video archiving costs. Further, it is supposed to capture a large field of view. Under these situations, a trespasser is only represented by a small no. of pixels in the video footage. This poses as a significant challenge in detecting low-resolution and blurry trespassers.
    
    \item \textbf{Background:} If the trespasser has some other object in the background, this may interfere with the detection. Depending upon the features, it might be hard to discriminate between background object and trespasser. 
    
    
    \item \textbf{Hard negatives:} Hard negatives are a source of false positives. They have visual features that look like humans but are actually not human. Typical examples include pictures and posters containing humans and electricity poles.

\begin{comment}
\subsection{State of the art}
Person detection problem has been studied extensively by the computer vision community. While conventional techniques tend to develop hand-crafted features, more recent work (deep learning based approaches) attempt to learn features from the data. Most of the deep-learning based person detection work borrows ideas from the general object detection research and integrates some domain knowledge such as aspect ratio of up-right human and visible body parts. 

These works however do not intend to solve trespassing detection problem.
Most of the surveillance video is expected to be sparse in terms of trespassing activity. Thus direct application of existing methods leads to extra computational costs.

\subsection{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
In order to fulfill our goals, we design a two step approach. Figure \ref{fig:trespassing-detection-framework} shows our approach.  In the first step, we decide whether a particular frame has activity or not. If it turns out that given frame has no activity, then it is classified as background frame. No further action needs to be taken for this frame. On the other hand, if it shows activity, then next step will be to investigate whether its human trespassing activity or not.
