While railroad trespassing is a dangerous activity with significant security and safety risks, regular patrolling of potential trespassing sites is infeasible due to high resource and personnel costs. There is thus a need to design a trespass detection and early warning prediction tool leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.  Given a video surveillance through security cameras, this thesis tackles the problem of detecting trespassing activity.  In particular, we adopt a CNN-based deep learning architecture (Faster-RCNN) as the core component of our solution. However, these deep learning-based methods, while effective, are shown to be computationally expensive and time consuming, especially when applied to a large amount of surveillance data. Given the sparsity of railroad trespassing activity, we design a dual-stage architecture composed of an inexpensive prefiltering stage for activity detection followed by a trespass detection stage for robust classification.  The former is responsible for filtering out frames that show little to no activity, this way reducing the amount of data to be processed by the later more compute-intensive stage.  The resulting dual-stage architecture represents a flexible solution capable of trading-off performance and computational time. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a public domain surveillance dataset.
